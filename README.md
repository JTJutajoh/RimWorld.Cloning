# RimWorld.Cloning

Allows you to use Biotech's growth vats to grow clones asexually from one donor parent regardless of fertility, copying their entire xenotype.
  
Under development, things might change and more features might get added in the future.

  
Future updates might add:
-A more interesting way to extract the embryo. Maybe a new building that also costs a lot of something like neutroamine and a lot of nutrition.
-An option to also inherit xenogenes in the clone.
-Random clone mutations as a negative consequence for rampant cloning.
-Clone mood maluses.
-Maybe someday a way to create a clone directly from stored genepacks?
-Ideology memes/precepts related to cloning ethics?
-Starting scenario based on Rich Explorer, but with the tech to start cloning themselves?
