  <description>Allows you to use Biotech's growth vats to grow clones asexually from only one donor parent regardless of fertility, copying their entire xenotype.
  
Under development, things might change and more features might get added in the future. Please report bugs on the steam page.

  
Future updates might add:
-Clone mood maluses.
-Maybe someday a way to create a clone directly from stored genepacks?
-Ideology memes/precepts related to cloning ethics?
-Starting scenario based on Rich Explorer, but with the tech to start cloning themselves?</description>
