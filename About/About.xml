  <description>Allows you to use Biotech's growth vats to grow clones asexually from only one donor parent regardless of fertility or age, copying their entire xenotype.
Also includes an optional mutations system where clones have a random chance to gain genes on birth. Settings allows you to customize overall mutation chance as well as which genes are eligible for mutation and how likely each gene is. Defaults are mostly negative mutations.


Under development, everything seems to work but there are likely to still be bugs and oversights. Please report bugs on the steam page.

## Compatibility
- ***Requires Biotech DLC.***
- **Not (currently) compatible with Humanoid Alien Races.** Coming soon hopefully.
- Should be compatible with Questionable Ethics Enhanced, even though they do the same thing in different ways.
- No other known incompatibilities, please let me know if you find one.



### Future plans
- Clone mood maluses.
- Maybe someday a way to create a clone directly from stored genepacks?
- Ideology memes/precepts related to cloning ethics?
- Starting scenario based on Rich Explorer, but with the tech to start cloning themselves?</description>
